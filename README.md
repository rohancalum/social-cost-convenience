# The social cost of commuting convenience: how cities must invest in accessible, public transit-oriented futures to avoid climate catastrophe


1. Basically [this](https://mapmyemissions.com/resources), but on an aggregate city-scale, where you route people to essential services AND their jobs. 
Come up with a rule for people to choose driving over transit (i.e. if transit time is 50% longer than driving to work, then default the person to driving. Perhaps assign some probability that the person is environmentally conscious and would be willing to transit even if it's 50% longer). 

2. Assign a value to each grid cell/census block for the "transit disadvantage factor" -- i.e. the sum of the trips in that block that take 50% longer than driving, weighted by the fraction of how much longer it takes, with an extra term to subtract if the residents are in low-income/high-income to get a measure of "equity". 

3. Perhaps these heatmaps could be overlaid over the existing transit network to show visually where the deficiencies lie, maybe it would be informative enough to suggest completely new route schemes.

4. Calculate the social cost/year of these people driving, and estimate the cost of adding a new route that would service these areas. Justify investment by saying the city would save on social cost... could also look into taxes used to pay for road infrastructure to meet the driving demand generated by poor transit options.

5. Discuss the ["frequency is freedom"](https://pedestrianobservations.com/2018/04/12/buses-in-brooklyn-frequency-is-freedom-but-15-minutes-isnt-frequency/) rule... There is also literature on how frequency isn't enough, it matters where that frequency is going (i.e. should be relevant to the residents of that area). 

6. Do this for a variety of cities that have notoriety for good transit, bad transit, big cities, small towns, etc.
